<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Felix Kabira Kagwi. I am currently 17 years old. I am in the process of learning Web Development.
  I recently finished my Form 5 exams at Gaborone Senior Secondary School here in Gaborone. 
  I did my pre-primary and Primary School education at Gaborone International School, where I wrote my Primary School leaving Examinatons at Std 7.

<p>I really enjoy cycling, I took up this hobby as a child and have never left it. Cycling alows me to escape from the pressures of this world and focus my energy on ensuring that I stay fit as a young person.
  I also enjoy playing football even though I am not that good yet (although I am not that much of a football fan).
  Playing games like chess alows me to focus on my concentration skills.
</p>

<p>
  I hope to pursue a course in which I work with computers, phones and everything tech. 
  I am also a dedicated Christian. 
  In the future I hope to become a succesful and great man.
  Thanks for reading this and I wish you well. ;-)
